# Angle Brackets Rise

Web based time aligment synchronization demo for media and lighting device.

This demo is for special song, Angle Brackets Rise, which was for 'Kobe Developer Meetup' - related event of TPAC 2025 in Kobe.

In this demonstration, I'm using WebVMT/DataCue API extension for WebVTT which is under propsing state in WICG, W3C.
My current activity is to apply lighting device control signal in it. For example, DMX device.
