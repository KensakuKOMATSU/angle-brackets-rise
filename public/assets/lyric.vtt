WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:06.000
“User agent, that’s you *W3C*... 
Cache cleared.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
The response is…  
200 OK.”

NOTE 1st block 

00:10.500 --> 00:13.000
We set the ground so no one slips,

00:13.000 --> 00:14.500
no hidden doors, 
no secret scripts.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.750
Raise every voice, 
let daylight in—

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
we shape the rules that let all begin.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.500
From tiny tags, 
living *Hypertext* takes the floor,

00:26.500 --> 00:30.000
we build a bridge from shore to shore.

NOTE block

00:30.500 --> 00:34.000
Hands up high like promises resolved by night,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
we write it once and make it work just right.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.500
Across the world, 
across each screen,

00:41.500 --> 00:45.500
one shared language, 
strong and clean.

NOTE 2nd block

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
You’re my Grid, 
I’m your Flex (It's *CSS*) 
—locked in time,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.750
Mind the gap; 
we find the perfect rhyme.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.000
But more than code, 
it’s hearts in tune—

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
a common path beneath one moon.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
We choose the words that welcome all,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
big or small, 
whatever you call.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Keep it fair, 
keep it kind,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.750
trust by design, 
with peace of mind.

NOTE block

01:11.000 --> 01:14.750
Raise the banner high—we meet and we align,

01:14.750 --> 01:19.000
Write it in the open, 
let our edges intertwine.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Across the sites, 
across the night,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.500
*One open WEB*
—we build it right.


NOTE block

01:35.000 --> 01:37.500
*WebRTC* sparks, 
all cameras ignite,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.500
*WebGPU* riffs, 
shaders bite.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
*Fetch* that hope, 
keep *Cookies same-site*,

01:41.500 --> 01:43.750
privacy by design—Secure, 
*Http-only* tight.

01:43.750 --> 01:51.000 
*Cross-origin* only with care;

01:51.000 --> 01:57.500
permissions prompt—be wise, 
be fair.

NOTE block

01:59.500 --> 02:03.250
Roll out with a shout—*let async*; 
don’t *await*.

02:03.250 --> 02:07.000
One open future—we won’t make it wait,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.750
From meeting rooms to city light,

02:10.750 --> 02:13.500    
we sign our names to do what’s right.

NOTE block

02:14.750 --> 02:18.750
Every voice we raised became one song,

02:18.750 --> 02:22.000    
Thread by thread, 
we weave a shining *NET*;

02:22.000 --> 02:26.750
Lift up your eyes—the curtains soaring high,

02:26.750 --> 02:29.750    
With you, we can change the world.

NOTE last block

02:47.500 --> 02:49.000
- Welcome to KOBE.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Ready, set?

03:13.750 --> 03:16.000
Let’s discuss our Web future.

03:16.100 --> 04:00.000
